		     'exclusiveType' will make this sound stop/fade out other sounds playing in the same component when it starts. 
		     'baseVolume' will set the baseVolume of this sound to play at a custom level (defaults to 1).  This is NOT an override, so other volume modifiers like global 
		                  volume and positioning can lower this volume further. -->
