			<text1>Oh, sorry, we're out of espresso. You can order something else off the menu.</text3>
			<text2>What can I get you?</text4>
			<text3>Interest you in a fair trade organic coffee today?</text5>
			<text4>My big break is coming any day now. I just missed out on a role as "Surprised Onlooker #3"!</text6>
			<text5>I'm working on a killer original screenplay, "The Explodo-Squad". It's like "Bomb-Bots" meets "The Robo-Bombers" but in outer space!</text7>

			<text1>What can I get you? Decaf, half-caf, mega-caf? Latte, espresso, latte-espresso?</text1>
			<text2>Oh, sorry, we're out of lattes. You can order something else off the menu.</text2>
			<text3>I can't believe you never heard of me... Willy Bingleman.</text3>
			<text4>That's right. It's me, WIlly Bingleman.</text4>
			<text5>You know... "Me no likey!"</text5>
			<text6>You never saw my big hit, "First-Grade Sourpuss"?</text6>
			<text7>Someday I'll get a serious role again, and everyone will likey me!</text7>
			<text8>At last! A chance to show off my dark side!</text8>
			<text9>...Who?</</text9>
			<text10>I don't follow.</text10>
			<text11>Sorry, never saw it.</text11>
			<text12>I, don't think he would make a good hero.</text12>

			<text1>I don't think he would make a good villain.</text1>
			<text2>This is a movie studio? Where is the crew, the cast?</text2>
			<text3>It doesn't take a lot of people to make a movie these days. You just need the right computer algorithms.</text3>
			<text4>But who writes the stories?</text4>
			<text5>Stories? Nobody cares about stories. Film-making these days is all about marketing! It's about putting rear ends in seats!</text5>
			<text6>That doesn't sound very exciting.</text6>
			<text7>Our data indicates that "Lord of the Witches 5" will gross 7.1% more overseas than "Lord of the Witches 4"! What could be more exciting?</text7>
			<text8>Acting isn't what it used to be. I once played Hamlet in the park! Now I stand around all day in this ridiculous suit.</text8>
			<text9>Finally, a heroic role! No more of this middle-earthiness for me.</text9>
			<text10>What's this place?</text10>
			<text11>Welcome to the top-grossing movie studio in the world!</text11>
			<text12>You make movies?</text12>
			<text13>That's right: this is where dreams are made.</text13>
			<text14>What are you working on now?</text14>
			<text15>We're making "Lord of the Witches 5: Redemption", the sequel to our box-office smash, "Lord of the Witches 4: Retaliation".</text15>

			<text1>Arf! Arf!</text1>
			<text2>Uh oh! Are you from studio security!</text2>
			<text3>Me? No.</text3>
			<text4>Thank goodness! We're so close to finishing our movie. It would be a tragedy to get caught now.</text4>
			<text5>Who's making a movie?</text5>
			<text6>Carson Willis, the greatest filmmaker of all time! And I'm his assistant director, Sofia May.</text6>
			<text7>Nice to meet you.</text7>
			<text8>Listen, feel free to head inside and check things out. Just stay out of the way, okay?</text8>
			<text9>We're going to blow our schedule if we can't get Kirk back in here.</text9>
			<text10>I've got a ton to do here -- can you go try to get him out of his trailer? You can take that cart.</text10>
			<text11>I like to do all my writing up here where I have a view of the hills.</text11>
			<text12>This is it! It's genius! My best work ever!</text12>
			<text13>Uh oh. This is not good.</text13>
			<text14>Now my script is scattered across Sunrise Street!</text14>
			<text15>I'm glad you were able to find all those pages. Now if I could just figure out how to get down...</text15>
			<text16>How...? You've completely foiled our security!</text16>
			<text17>Tell you what: leave here now, and we'll let you keep anything you've taken.</text17>
			<text18>You may have a future as a stunt driver.</text18>
			<text19>I don't think we're in Poptropica anymore!</text19>
			<text20>The sign says, "For official back lot business only!"</text20>

			<text1>He's the star of the movie. You understand? There's no movie without the star.</text1>
			<text2>You've saved my production! I might have a few more tasks for you. Meet me on the soundstage when you're ready.</text2>
			<text3>You ruined my picture. Now, you'd better figure out how to save it!</text3>
			<text4>Save my picture!</text4>
			<text5>Go away!</text5>
			<text6>Refill my half-caf leviathan latte-espresso, on the double!</text6>
			<text7>That doesn't smell like a half-caf leviathan latte-espresso!</text7>
			<text8>You can refill my half-caf leviathan latte-espresso, on the double!</text8>
			<text9>A little common courtesy, that's all I ask. I shall be back on set momentarily.</text9>
			<text10>What do we do?</text10>
			<text11>No one is there.</text11>
			<text12>I've got your coffee, sir.</text12>
			<text13>What can I do to make you come out of there?</text13>
