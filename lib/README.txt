This file is here to answer the question:

What do all these SWCs do for us?

fl_package.swc
This is from Adobe. It supplies the fl package, which contains many classes we take for granted after producing content with Adobe Flash Professional. Some highlights: FLVPlayback (Quantcast uses this), Color, ComboBox

as3commons-collections-1.3.2.swc
This supplies a fancy Dictionary or something that Billy liked. I think it used only in one place. TODO: find that place(s).

greensock.swc
This is the TweenMax library.

nape-dev.swc
This is a physics engine. It is used in a couple of scenes. Use this more.

robotlegs-framework-v2.0.0b1.swc
Richard Lord uses this? In Ash? Or where?

Swiftsuspenders-v2.0.0rc1.swc
This, I think, is what we use for Dependency Injection. Unless it's not. In which case, it might be that we use part of the robotlegs SWC for Dependency Injection. Would be nice to know this.

com.milkmangames.extensions.StoreKit.ane
Used for In-App-Purchasing (IAP) in iOS mobile apps.

analytics.swc
The Google Analytics library for AS3
